## Camera frame to robot base frame transformation (3D pose, X, Y, Z)

This work is correspond to the transformation or extrinsic calibrtio between the camera to robot base frame which Eye-To-Hand Calibration Process.

<!-- The method is using TSAI method in order to perform extrinsic calibration process. -->

This testing, we assumed that we already have the intrinsic and extrinsic calibrated files that we have done, then we apply these files into loading the detection model with considering this transformation between the camera and frame and robot base frame.
